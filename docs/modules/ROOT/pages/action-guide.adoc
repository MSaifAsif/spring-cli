= Action Guide

== Generate

The `generate` action is used to generate files.  It requires a `to` key to specify the destination path.
The path is relative where the user-defined command was executed.  If the file already exists, it will not be overwritten.

The content of the file is defined using the `text` key.

Here's a simple example of the `generate` action is:


```yml
actions:
  - generate:
      to:  hello.txt
      text: Hello {{user-name}} on {{os-name}}.
```

The variables `{{user-name}}` and `{{os-name}} will be replaced with actual values using the Handlebars template engine.
Command line options passed to user-defined command are exposed as variables to be used by the template engine.

For more information on predefined template engine variables, refer to the xref:user-command-guide.adoc#_template_engine[Template Engine] section.

=== Literal syntax

YAML's literal syntax allows representing multi-line strings or preserving formatting and whitespace within a string.

The literal syntax is useful when you want to maintain line breaks, indentation, but some special characters must be escaped with a slash character.

Here's an example of using the literal syntax in YAML:

```yml
actions:
  - generate:
      to:  hello.txt
      text: |
        This is a multi-line
        string using the literal syntax.
        It preserves the line breaks
        and indentation exactly as written.
        \t This is a tab character.
        \n This is a newline character.
        \\ This is a backslash.
        \u2713 This is a Unicode character (checkmark symbol).
```

By using the | character followed by an indented block, the string is treated as a literal, and line breaks and indentation are preserved.

=== External file

In some cases, it is diffiuclt to embed text using the literal syntax due to required escaping.
JSON files, regular expresssions, and file paths are common examples where such difficulties arise.
Additionally, you may want to edit the text content separately from the action file to leverage syntax highlighting and validation features of text editors.

To address these cases, you can use the from key to specify the source file for generating the text.

Here's an example using the `from` key
```
actions:
  - generate:
      to:  hello.json
      from: json-template.json
```

The `to` key is relative to the director where the command is executed.

The file `json-template.json` is located in the same directory as the command, `.spring/commands/hello/create` and its contents are:

```json
{
  "operatingSystem": "{{os-name}}",
  "phoneNumbers": [
    {
      "type": "iPhone",
      "number": "0123-4567-8888"
    },
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "0123-4567-8910"
    }
  ]
}
```

Executing `spring hello create` from the xref:action-file-overview.adoc#_an_introductory_example[introductory example] produces the file `hello.json` as shown below

```
$ spring hello create
Generated /home/testing/rest-service/hello.json

$ cat hello.json
```
```json
{
  "operatingSystem": "Linux",
  "phoneNumbers": [
    {
      "type": "iPhone",
      "number": "0123-4567-8888"
    },
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "0123-4567-8910"
    }
  ]
}
```


=== Variable replacement in keys

You can also use Handlebars template variables in the `to`, `from` and `text` keys.

Here is an example that uses Handlebars template variables in the `to` key.

```yml
actions:
  - generate:
      to: src/main/java/{{root-package-dir}}/{{feature}}/{{capitalizeFirst feature}}Controller.java
      from: RestController.java
```

For more information on predefined template engine variables, refer to the xref:user-command-guide.adoc#_template_engine[Template Engine] section.

== Inject

The `inject` action is used to inject text into a file.

You need to define either the `after:` key or the `before:` to indicate the location where to inject the text.

Here is a sample file.

```text
hello there
this is a test file
we are going to insert before the line that has the word marker1
marker2
```

An `inject` action that will inject the text `INJECTED AFTER` after the line that contains the word `marker2` is:

```yaml
actions:
  - inject:
      to: sample.txt
      text: "INJECTED AFTER"
      after: marker2
```

The text file after running this action is:

```text
hello there
this is a test file
we are going to insert before the line that has the word marker1
marker2
INJECTED AFTER
```

An `inject` action that will inject the text `INJECTED BEFORE` before the line that contains the word `marker1` is:

```yaml
actions:
  - inject:
      to: sample.txt
      text: "INJECTED BEFORE"
      before: marker1
```

The text file after running this action is:

```text
hello there
this is a test file
INJECTED BEFORE
we are going to insert before the line that has the word marker1
marker2
```



== Exec

The `exec` action is used to execute a shell command.

The basic form to execute a shell command is:

```yam.
actions:
  - exec:
      command: mkdir {{tmp-dir}}/scratch
```


The template engine variable `tmp-dir` is defined by default and is the value of the Java System Property `java.io.tmpdir`.
