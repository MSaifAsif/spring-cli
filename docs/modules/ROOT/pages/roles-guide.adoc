= Roles

Roles provide a way to organize and reuse variables across user-defined commands.

By default, the Spring CLI includes an unnamed role that is always available. If no specific role is specified, commands will use the default role.

To further customize and differentiate roles, you can associate them with specific names. These named roles are stored as YAML files within the `.spring/roles` directory, located alongside the `.spring/commands` directory.

Roles enable you to define variables that can be accessed in an Action File using Handlebars, allowing you to share data between commands.

Furthermore, roles can be utilized to supply values for command line options. If a command line option doesn't have a specified value, and there exists a role variable with the same name as the command option, the command will automatically use the value of the role variable for that specific option.

== Quick Start

In this quick start, we'll demonstrate how to add variables to the default role and use their values when generating a file.

Let's being by setting the value of the role variable 'greeting' to 'Mondo':

[source,bash]
----
$ spring role set --key greeting --value Mondo
Key-value pair added to the default role
----

The key-value pair is stored in the `./spring/roles/vars.yml` file under the root project directory

To retrieve the value of the variable, use the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ spring role get --key greeting
Mondo
----

Let's create another Role Variable:

[source,bash]
----
$ spring role set --key language --value Italian
Key-value pair added to the default role
----

Now, let's incorporate these variables into a User Defined Command.
Create a user-defined command named  `hello say`

[source,bash]
----
$ spring command new --command-name hello --sub-command-name say
Created user defined command /home/mark/testing-spring-cli/roles/myapp/.spring/commands/hello/say
----

Inside the `.spring/commands/hello/say` direcotry, you'll find the `command.yaml` with the following contents:

[source,yaml]
----
command:
  description: Generate a new file with a hello message
  options:
    #
    - name: greeting
      description: who or what to say hello to
      dataType: string
      defaultValue: World
      inputType: text
----

Note that the Command Line Option name is `greeting`, which matches the name of the Role Variable we created.

Within the `.spring/commands/hello/say` directory, there is the Action File `hello.yaml` with the following contents:

[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - generate:
      to: hello.txt
      text: Hello {{greeting}} on {{os-name}}.
----

Update the file to include:

[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  - generate:
      to: hello.txt
      text: Hello {{greeting}} on {{os-name}}. {{#if language}} {{language}} {{/if}}

----

When executing the command without passing the `greeting` Command Line Option, the value of `greeting` will be obtained from the Role Variable with the same name instead of using the default value of `World`.

Additionally, since we have defined the Role Variable language, we can test its existence and include its value in the output. Note that language is not a command line option.

[source,bash]
----
$ spring hello say
Using Role variable instead of default command line option for key = greeting , value = Mondo from the default role
Generated /home/mark/testing-spring-cli/roles/myapp/hello.txt
----

The generated file contains:

[source]
----
Hello Mondo on Linux.  Italian
----

The value of `{{greeting}}` comes from the Role Variable because it was not provided as a command line option.

The `{{language}}` variable was not a command line option, but it is is available to use with Handlebars expressions.

Let's remove the generated file, in the interactive shell run `. ! rm hello.txt`, and pass in the `greeting` command line option.

[source,bash]
----
$ spring hello say --greeting amico
----

The generated file contains:

[source]
----
Hello amico on Linux.  Italian
----

== Setting variables

To set a value for a Role Variable, use the `spring role set` command:

[source]
----
spring role set --key greeting --value Mondo
----

You can optionally specify the role using the `--role` option.

== Getting variables

To retrieve the value of a Role Variable, use the following command:

[source]
----
spring role get --key greeting
----

You can optionally specify the role using the --role option.

The Role Variable greeting can then be accessed inside Action files that utilize Handlebars templating. Refer to the quick start section for an example.

The Role Variable is also used to match against User Defined Command option names. If a value is not explicitly provided as a command line option, the value of the Role Variable will be used.

You can also use the special command `. !` to view the full contents of the file that contains Role Variables when you are in the interactive shell:

[source]
----
spring:>. ! cat .spring/roles/vars.yml
greeting: mondo
----

== Adding a Role

To add a role, use the following command:

[source]
----
spring role add qa
----

This crates a role named `qa`.

A file named  `./spring/roles/vars-qa.yml` is created under the root project directory.

== Listing Roles

To list the available roles, use the following command:

[source]
----
spring role list
----

This will display th elist of roles:

[source]
----
┌────┐
│Name│
├────┤
│qa  │
└────┘
----

== Removing a Role

To remove a role, use the following command:

[source]
----
spring role remove qa
----
